If my team is doing continuous delivery of software, It's better to adopt a much simpler workflow (like GitHub flow) instead of trying to shoehorn git-flow into my team.

If, however, I'm building software that is explicitly versioned, or if I need to support multiple versions of your software in the wild, then git-flow may still be as good of a fit to my team as it has been to people in the last 10 years. In that case, please read on.

To conclude, always remember that panaceas don't exist. Consider my own context. Don't be hating. Decide for myself.
